# ForgeModding — learning log

Append-only harvest index. **The log is never a rule's home** — the rule itself is written into its owning doc/skill/hook (see CLAUDE.md's write-back task); each entry here just records that it happened, so `/base:promote` can find generic lessons and carry them to ClaudeBase. Every written-back lesson gets its entry **in the same edit** (the `check-lesson-tagging` hook nudges when one is missing its tags).

Entry statuses: `candidate` → `promoted-pr` (PR opened, add the URL) → `merged` | `rejected`. A `scope: generic` candidate with 2+ `applications:` dates is promotion-ready.

The entry shape (copy it, replacing every `<...>` — the angle brackets are what keep
this example from being scanned as a real candidate by `/base:promote`):

```
## <YYYY-MM-DD> — <short-imperative-slug>
- scope: <generic | project>
- status: <candidate>
- rule: <ONE imperative sentence — the rule as written into its home>
- home: <path#section where the rule now lives>
- evidence: <file:line / exact error text / N — the demoted story>
- applications: <date>[, <date>...]
```
